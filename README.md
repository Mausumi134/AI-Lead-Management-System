## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: npm comes with Node.js, so if you have Node.js installed, you already have npm.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mausumi134/AI-Lead-Management-System.git
```

### 2. Install Backend Dependencies
Navigate to the backend folder and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd AI-Lead-Management-System
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Backend Server
Start the backend server by running:

node server.js
```

The backend server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 4. Install Frontend Dependencies
In a new terminal window, navigate to the `frontend` folder:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 5. Start the Frontend Server
Start the frontend development server by running:

The frontend server will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### 6. Access the Application
